# Professional Launch - Client Project

Professional Launch is a client project completed for the Emerging Digital Academy in Fargo, ND by Abdullahia Ali, Amber Schaack and Scott Schulte. It is a user focused application used to foster mentoring relationships for Professional Lunch, a local non-profit organization, focusing on creating a powerful and robust mentoring and learning platform that helps under-connected young professionals develop and build social capital. 

## Description

The Professional Launch Mentorship management system is a web-based, mobile-first, application designed to facilitate and manage mentorship relationships. The system allows mentors and mentees to create profiles, establish connections, and propose meetings. This will allow mentees to develop their skills, build a professional network, and receive guidance on career advancement to achieve career goals. Additionally, the system provides an admin interface for managing relationships and data within the application.
